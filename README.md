**WC26 Predictor** is a personal Machine Learning project focused on predicting international matches, with a special emphasis on the *FIFA World Cup 2026*. Using the [**international_results**](https://github.com/martj42/international_results) dataset, the system estimates each national team's offensive and defensive strength through a Dixon-Coles model. With these estimates, two expected-goals prediction approaches are trained:

- A Bayesian MCMC model
- An XGBoost regression model

The goal predictions are transformed into a probability matrix based on `Poisson` distributions, which allows the final 1X2 outcome probabilities to be calculated.

## Running the project

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies and run the interactive interface:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Visualizing results

Optionally, you can generate visualizations of the results with `pyplot` from the interactive interface.

The generated plots are stored in the `outputs/` directory.

## No-color mode

If your terminal doesn't support ANSI colors, you can use the following command:

```bash
NO_COLOR=1 python main.py
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This project was developed for educational and research purposes.** Although the model may produce interesting predictions, it is not recommended for use in betting, since no model can predict football's inherent uncertainty.

That said, the program has personally produced accurate results on a few occasions. This should be considered anecdotal and not a reliable statistical basis.

## Testing

The project has an automated *testsuite* that you can run with:

```bash
pytest -v
```
